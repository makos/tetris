# Tetris
Clone of Tetris in C and SDL3.

## Building
Requires SDL3 installed. Just run `make` and then `./tetris`.

## Controls
- left and right arrows - move left and right
- Z or up arrow - rotate clockwise
- X or control - rotate counterclockwise
- down arrow - soft drop
- space - hard drop
- escape - pause and exit
- R - restart - works only in main menu

## Bugs
Possibly many. This is WIP and a practice project, so it's made mostly for me to learn.
